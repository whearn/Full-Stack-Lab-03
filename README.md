# Lab 03: 99 Lines of Code In The File - Part 2
## Due: Friday, June 2nd, 09:00
##### Covalence
###### Full Stack: Summer 2017

## Info
* This lab consists of two parts
* Today you will be transforming part 1 of the lab
* You should copy your files from part 1 and paste them into your new project folder for part 2 (lab 3)
* Except for one part of this lab where you are explicitly asked to delete, you will not be deleting or destroying anything from yesterday. You are simply changing/transitioning what you did yesterday into something more useful.

## Objectives
* You already have an array called `friends`. It holds five of your friends' names.
* For every friend in the friend array, you have successfully used `console.log` to log the chorus line of the song 99 times.
* In the HTML, the page title should be 99 Lines of Code In The File
* Put an `h1` in the html body that says My Singing Friends
* Put a `div` in the html body with a class of `friend`.
    * Inside the `div`, put 5 `p`.
    * Inside each `p`, put Test1, Test2, Test3, etc.
* Style the page
    * Set a background color on the page.
    * Change the text color of the h1.
    * Set a background color for class `friend`.
    * Target the paragraphs inside the `friend` class div and make them uppercase using only CSS.
    * You have stylistic freedom to make the page look good
### New Objectives
* Put a `button` in the HTML that says `Sing!`
    * When you click the button, all the `console.log` statements from yesterday should happen. They SHOULD NOT happen before the button is clicked.
* When you have the button setup and working correctly as described, then:
    * Delete the `div` with class `friend` and the paragraphs it contains from your html file
    * Go to your code where you are "singing the song" and change it as follows:
        * For each of your friends, create a `div` with class `friend`
        * Put an `h3` containing your friend's name in the div
        * Then, instead of using `console.log` to put the song lyrics in the console, create a paragraph for each song lyric line and put that paragraph in the `friend` div.
    * Edit your CSS. Instead of making `p` elements inside the div class `friend` uppercase, make `h3` elements uppercase
* To Recap:
    * The page should start out just showing a button labeled Sing!
    * Nothing will be logged to the console
    * Clicking the button will cause 5 `div` elements with class name `friend` to be added to the page, one for each of your friends
    * Each div contains 99 paragraphs, each one representing a lyric line that you previously were logging to the console in part 1 of this lab.

## Hints
* You will be using DOM functions to complete this portion of the lab
* Remember that elements can be added to other elements
    * document.body.appendChild(someElement);
    * someElement.appendChild(someOtherElement);
